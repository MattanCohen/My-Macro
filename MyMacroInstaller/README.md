# Installer

my_macro setup couldn't be simpler.
to use it just download and open the file "MyMacroInstaller.exe", choose the directory you want the python code to be installed to and hit install.

to uninstall, go to the install directory you chose and double click the "uninstall" file.



I provided the NSIS code that created the setup for your free use.

in order to change the python script and make the installer install the changed script, you'll need to get the NSIS application from https://nsis.sourceforge.io/Download, follow the instructions to install NSIS on your pc and run it and select "Compile NSI scripts". Then load the "my_macro_installer.nsi" file and the installer will update :)
