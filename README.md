# My-Macro
A unique macro system I developed to create user-made macros.

This system will allow you to use the pynput.Events() function as a keyboard listener in the background the second the computer is starting up.

the script running in the background will be my_macro.py so change it as you wish.

In order to make the system start whenever you start the computer, create a shortcut of the my_macro.vbs file, hit Winkey+R and type "shell:startup" and copy the vbs shortcut you created in the folder that opened (C:\Users\User\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup).



My Macro provided macros (youre welcome to add or remove as you like):
